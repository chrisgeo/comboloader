WHAT CAN IT DO?
---------------
  * Replace url() tags with:
    - data uris

WHAT I WANT IT TO DO
--------------------
  * Ability to use a dependency graph for a file
  * automatically replace url() with either:
      - provided base url for a CDN, etc

##### Example config

ComboLoader
    WSGI App that is used in combination with another service/server that will allow the combining of any javascript or CSS files into a single, minimized (if not already), file and cache it.
    
    Example INI:
    
    [server:main]
    use = egg:Paste#http
    host = 0.0.0.0
    port = 80
    
    [composite:main]
    use = egg:Paste#urlmap
    / = YOURAPP
    /combo  = loader
    
    [app:loader]
    use = egg:comboloader
    base_js_dir = %(here)s/../howler/python/howler/howler/public/js
    base_css_dir = %(here)s/css/
    use_config = False

    [app:YOURAPP]
    use = egg:YOURAPP
    full_stack = true


COMMON ISSUES
--------------

python-magic
  This is required for automatically finding the mime-type of a file without depending on extensions, etc. As such, it requires libmagic to be installed. A known issue with python-magic on darwin (OS X) systems is that it depends on MacPorts. This will hopefully be fixed soon.
